# apps/docs — the Fumadocs site

A **browser** application. It documents and showcases the GPUix-native library;
it does not render it. See `MISSION.md`, plan `410-docs-site.md`, and
`docs/preview-strategy.md`.

## Stack

Fumadocs + TanStack Start (SSR), built with Vite, Tailwind 4 and
`fumadocs-mdx`. It deploys as a Cloudflare Worker through
`packages/deploy/alchemy.run.docs.ts` (`rootDir: "../../apps/docs"`).

## Commands

```sh
nub run --filter docs dev           # http://localhost:3000
nub run --filter docs build         # SSR bundle + client assets
nub run --filter docs check-types   # fumadocs-mdx generate + tsc --noEmit
nub run --filter docs test          # registry, IA, search, theme and preview tests
nub run check                       # repo gate: test quality, lint, format, types
```

## Layout

```
content/docs/**              the MDX pages; meta.json sets the sidebar order
src/routes/                  TanStack Start routes (landing, docs catch-all, search)
src/lib/source.ts            the Fumadocs content source
src/components/              MDX components (index, state, previews)
src/component-meta/          the component registry (plan 411)
public/screenshots/          real native screenshots (plan 412)
```

## Adding a component page

1. Add a record to `src/component-meta/entries.ts`. **Titles must match the
   `COMPONENTS.md` row exactly** — `registry.test.ts` proves the two agree.
   Start `status: "planned"`, `gpuix: "unverified"`.
2. Add `content/docs/components/<slug>.mdx` using the template below, and add
   the slug to `content/docs/components/meta.json`. `registry.test.ts` asserts
   that sidebar equals `index` plus every non-planned slug, so a forgotten
   entry (or a component with no page) fails the suite.
3. Move the record out of `planned` only when the component is real. The tests
   then require a `sourcePath`, the page file, and the sidebar entry.
4. When the playground has captured the component, add the PNGs under
   `public/screenshots/<slug>/` **and** the `provenance.json` sidecar the capture
   script writes. A screenshot without a sidecar is never rendered.

title: Button
description: Triggers an action; the primary interactive control.

<ComponentState slug="button" />

<NativePreview slug="button" />

Prop tables use `fumadocs-typescript`'s remark plugin: write
`<auto-type-table path="./relative/path.ts" name="ButtonProps" />` in the MDX
and annotate the real props type with tsdoc (`@internal` hides a prop). The
table is generated at build time from the component source, so it cannot drift.

The page's `<title>`, `description`, `og:title`, `og:description` and canonical
link come from its frontmatter through `src/lib/page-meta.ts`, so a new page
never inherits the site title.

## Previews

`<NativePreview slug>` picks the strongest honest tier from the record plus the
capture sidecars (`src/components/preview/select-preview.ts`):

- a listed screenshot **with** its `provenance.json` → the real capture (tier S);
- otherwise a `playgroundScreen` → the run instructions (tier N);
- otherwise the "not verified" notice (tier X).

An approximation is never a fallback. The only way to render one is
`<IllustrativeApproximation>`, which always renders the mandated banner.

## Honesty rules

Every preview obeys `docs/preview-strategy.md`. This app must never import
`@gpuixui/*` runtime code or `@gpuix/react` — it reads the real TypeScript
*source* for prop tables and copyable snippets, and nothing else.
`src/architecture.test.ts` enforces that boundary over `src/**`.
