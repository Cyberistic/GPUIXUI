# Implementation Plans

**This directory is the swarm's first deliverable.** No implementation work
starts until the plan set below exists and is indexed here.

Each plan is **self-contained for a weaker executor**. That means, at minimum:

- the exact files to create or change, and their exact paths;
- the exact commands to run, and the expected result of each;
- **STOP conditions** — the point at which the executor must stop and report
  rather than improvise;
- a **test plan** — which tests to write, what they must be able to catch, and
  how to prove the test fails without the fix;
- the acceptance criteria that let the executor say "done".

Naming: `NNN-kebab-title.md`, numbered in dependency order. One plan per phase,
one per package, plus a plan for each cross-cutting concern (native smoke test,
licensing, docs site).

## The plan set

| Plan | Title | Phase | Depends on | Status |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| [010](./010-phase-b-design-tokens.md) | Phase B: design tokens and theming | B | Phase A audit | done |
| [011](./011-package-tokens.md) | Package: `@gpuixui/tokens` | B | 010 | done |
| [012](./012-docs-design-system.md) | Docs: design system and token catalogue | B | 011 | done |
| [013](./013-high-contrast-theme.md) | High-contrast accessibility themes | B | 011 | done |
| [014](./014-status-tones-and-colour-helpers.md) | Status tones and colour helpers | B | 011, 013 | done |

Plans 010–014 are the `tokens-theme` workstream. They own `packages/tokens`,
`docs/tokens.md` and `docs/design-system.md`; every other plan belongs to the
agent that owns its paths.

## How to use a plan

1. Read it fully before starting. Do not skim the STOP conditions.
2. Work only inside your own worktree (`workspaces/<workstream>/`).
3. Run every command in the plan; a command that was not run did not pass.
4. On a STOP condition, stop and report with the evidence. Do not improvise a
   workaround that the plan did not authorise.
5. When done, update this table's status column and tick the matching task in
   `TODO.md`.
