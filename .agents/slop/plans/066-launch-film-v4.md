# 066 — Launch film v4: Paper's calm, a bento of components, a dashboard built

| Status | in progress |

## Owner notes (2026-11-01)

1. The Tabs close-up looks bad (tall pills, tiny labels).
2. The Omarchy display looks bad; use a better Linux example (067).
3. The first few seconds are far too quick.
4. Use the stageshow skill (`~/GPUIXUI/references/benjitaylor-skills/stageshow`)
   for a bento-style display of the components.
5. Better, rounded charts (065).
6. Follow `~/Documents/paper.mp4`.

## Diagnosis

- **Tabs**: the film magnified the *theme* 5×, but the library's recipes compile
  shadcn's fixed metrics (ADR 0006: `text-sm` = 14, `px-3` = 12). The rail grew
  with `controlHeight`; the label and its padding stayed 1×. The macro idea is
  wrong for any recipe component. **Fix**: every take renders the library at
  1× (no `magnify`); captures are 2×, so the composition's camera may push in
  up to 2× with no loss. Stageshow's close-up rule is 1.3–1.6×.
- **Pace**: v3 gave each control 15 frames (0.5 s). Paper gives each line about
  3 s and each interaction 1.5–3 s; stageshow: overlapping beats, a payoff that
  holds 2 s, nothing still for more than 3 s.

## Paper, measured again (contact sheets at 2 fps)

- Ground: warm paper `#F4F2EE` with a faint 48 px grid; ink `#1D1D1F`.
- One lowercase line at a time, centred above the action, ~3 s each; lines chain
  ("tabs, now in Paper" → "so you can get more done" → "let your agents" →
  "work across different files" → "at the same time" → "stay in flow" → "keep
  exploring" → "try tabs today / paper.design" → mark).
- The camera pans slowly across one continuous surface; a single control in
  close-up for ~2 s (a tab being typed), then pulls back to rows of tabs.
- **A dashboard is built**: blank canvas → blue blueprint outlines of every box →
  the real filled dashboard. That is the owner's "components falling onto a
  blank slate", told the way the reference tells it.

## The cut (30 s, 120 BPM; a beat is 15 frames)

| Time | Line | Picture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0–3 | "native apps, now in react" | The outline mark on paper; the cursor clicks it; the Settings window opens at 1× (macOS), camera settles |
| 3–9 | "built from the components you know" | Three close-ups, 2 s each, pushed in 1.6×: Switch toggled, Tabs (Arena → Island), Slider dragged; each tap with its sound |
| 9–13 | "composed into blocks" | **Bento** (stageshow rules): hero = the stats dashboard with the new charts (2×1), Slang's keypad cropped (1×2), a stat tile "60 fps", a statement tile "shadcn + tailwind", a Switch tile; tiles arrive 100 ms apart |
| 13–17 | "watch one come together" | **Blueprint build**: the stats block's real boxes as blue outlines on paper, drawn in reading order, then the real frame fills in over them |
| 17–21 | "on every desktop" | macOS window → Windows (the Aero desktop) → Linux (the tiling block, 067), one palette change |
| 21–25 | "even in your terminal" | The console block in a terminal: sidebar collapses, toasts arrive; then Slang computes in a terminal |
| 25–27 | "gpui · react · shadcn · tailwind" | type only |
| 27–30 | — | The mark, `gpuixui.sudokw.com`, "Made with ☕ by @sudo_kw" |

## Takes

- Remove `magnify`/`macro` from close-ups; close-ups render at 1× in a
  960×540 stage and are pushed in by the composition.
- New: `bento-*` stills/takes are the existing block takes; `blueprint` dumps
  the stats block's painted boxes (`getElementBounds` of every element with a
  background or border) to `boxes.json` beside its frames.
- `tiling` take (067) at 1280×800.
- `term-slang` with the terminal rig (`slang` program).

## Composition

Committed generator (`media/launch/build.ts`, run with nub) writes the scene
HTML from one timeline table, so a retime is one edit and survives a context
loss. Ground and grid from Paper. Tactile cues placed from the takes' press
frames. Score: re-use `sound/piano.ts`, retimed if needed.

## Verification

- `npx hyperframes check`; snapshots at every line change and every press.
- Contact sheet at 2 fps next to Paper's; the first 9 s must hold each control
  ≥ 1.5 s.
- Loudness −19 ± 1 LUFS.

## STOP

- Any take that shows a broken component (like the v3 Tabs) is fixed in the
  library or dropped, never shipped.
