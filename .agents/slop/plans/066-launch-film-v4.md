# 066 — Launch film v4: Paper's calm, a bento of components, a dashboard built

| Status | landed |

## Owner notes (2026-11-01)

1. The Tabs close-up looks bad (tall pills, tiny labels).
2. The Omarchy display looks bad; use a better Linux example (067).
3. The first few seconds are far too quick.
4. Use the stageshow skill (`~/GPUIXUI/references/benjitaylor-skills/stageshow`)
   for a bento-style display of the components.
5. Better, rounded charts (065).
6. Follow `~/Documents/paper.mp4`.

## Diagnosis

- **Tabs**: the film magnified the *theme* 5×, but the library's recipes compile
  shadcn's fixed metrics (ADR 0006: `text-sm` = 14, `px-3` = 12). The rail grew
  with `controlHeight`; the label and its padding stayed 1×. The macro idea is
  wrong for any recipe component. **Fix**: every take renders the library at
  1× (no `magnify`); captures are 2×, so the composition's camera may push in
  up to 2× with no loss. Stageshow's close-up rule is 1.3–1.6×.
- **Pace**: v3 gave each control 15 frames (0.5 s). Paper gives each line about
  3 s and each interaction 1.5–3 s; stageshow: overlapping beats, a payoff that
  holds 2 s, nothing still for more than 3 s.

## Paper, measured again (contact sheets at 2 fps)

- Ground: warm paper `#F4F2EE` with a faint 48 px grid; ink `#1D1D1F`.
- One lowercase line at a time, centred above the action, ~3 s each; lines chain
  ("tabs, now in Paper" → "so you can get more done" → "let your agents" →
  "work across different files" → "at the same time" → "stay in flow" → "keep
  exploring" → "try tabs today / paper.design" → mark).
- The camera pans slowly across one continuous surface; a single control in
  close-up for ~2 s (a tab being typed), then pulls back to rows of tabs.
- **A dashboard is built**: blank canvas → blue blueprint outlines of every box →
  the real filled dashboard. That is the owner's "components falling onto a
  blank slate", told the way the reference tells it.

## The cut (30 s, 120 BPM; a beat is 15 frames)

| Time | Line | Picture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0–3 | "native apps, now in react" | The outline mark on paper; the cursor clicks it; the Settings window opens at 1× (macOS), camera settles |
| 3–9 | "built from the components you know" | Three close-ups, 2 s each, pushed in 1.6×: Switch toggled, Tabs (Arena → Island), Slider dragged; each tap with its sound |
| 9–13 | "composed into blocks" | **Bento** (stageshow rules): hero = the stats dashboard with the new charts (2×1), Slang's keypad cropped (1×2), a stat tile "60 fps", a statement tile "shadcn + tailwind", a Switch tile; tiles arrive 100 ms apart |
| 13–17 | "watch one come together" | **Blueprint build**: the stats block's real boxes as blue outlines on paper, drawn in reading order, then the real frame fills in over them |
| 17–21 | "on every desktop" | macOS window → Windows (the Aero desktop) → Linux (the tiling block, 067), one palette change |
| 21–25 | "even in your terminal" | The console block in a terminal: sidebar collapses, toasts arrive; then Slang computes in a terminal |
| 25–27 | "gpui · react · shadcn · tailwind" | type only |
| 27–30 | — | The mark, `gpuixui.sudokw.com`, "Made with ☕ by @sudo_kw" |

## Takes

- Remove `magnify`/`macro` from close-ups; close-ups render at 1× in a
  960×540 stage and are pushed in by the composition.
- New: `bento-*` stills/takes are the existing block takes; `blueprint` dumps
  the stats block's painted boxes (`getElementBounds` of every element with a
  background or border) to `boxes.json` beside its frames.
- `tiling` take (067) at 1280×800.
- `term-slang` with the terminal rig (`slang` program).

## Composition

Committed generator (`media/launch/build.ts`, run with nub) writes the scene
HTML from one timeline table, so a retime is one edit and survives a context
loss. Ground and grid from Paper. Tactile cues placed from the takes' press
frames. Score: re-use `sound/piano.ts`, retimed if needed.

## Verification

- `npx hyperframes check`; snapshots at every line change and every press.
- Contact sheet at 2 fps next to Paper's; the first 9 s must hold each control
  ≥ 1.5 s.
- Loudness −19 ± 1 LUFS.

## STOP

- Any take that shows a broken component (like the v3 Tabs) is fixed in the
  library or dropped, never shipped.

## Stageshow (owner, 2026-11-01: "just use the skill of stageshow")

Two shots are built with the stageshow skill (`~/GPUIXUI/references/benjitaylor-skills/stageshow`,
MIT), following its SKILL.md workflow: plan, film the closest gold, copy its
structure, rehearse with `scripts/film.mjs --gate`. Every product picture inside
a stage is **real GPUix footage** (a take's frames, played on the stage's own
clock); the stage draws only the page, the tiles, the copy and the motion. No
component is drawn in DOM and presented as the library.

### Bento (9–13 s) — gold `bento` (hero and strip)

| Tile | Span | Kind | The one thing | Words |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Blocks | 2 × 1 | Hero UI | the stats block, Month pressed, window off the right edge | **Every block, native.** Painted by GPUI, written in React. |
| Count | 1 × 1 | Stat (dark) | the real component count, counting up | "components" + one line |
| Switch | 1 × 1 | Component | the Wi-Fi switch close-up, pressed | **shadcn's API.** The props you know. |
| Slang | 1 × 1 | Component | Slang's keypad, 7 × 6 = 42 | **Slang.** A calculator built on it. |
| Platforms | 1 × 1 | Diagram | macOS, Windows, Linux, Terminal chips, lines drawing into one GPUI node | **One tree, everywhere.** |

One window in the grid (the hero's). Tiles play one beat each, 110 ms apart.

### Assemble (13–17 s) — gold `subscriptions` (`Fly`)

The stats screen's blueprint (`boxes.json`: every painted box, blue outlines on
the paper ground) draws in reading order; then the screen's real cards, cropped
from its native frame, fly in from below the stage with `Fly` and land in their
slots one by one (KPI row, bars, ring, line), 160 ms apart; the payoff holds.
The film then cuts on the beat to the live stats take.

### Files

```
media/launch/stage/
  setup.sh          copy the skill into .media/stageshow, npm ci, link our scenes
  scenes/bento/     index.tsx + bento.css
  scenes/assemble/  index.tsx + assemble.css
  record/           index.html + main.tsx: installVirtualClock(30 fps), one scene at 1920×1080
  record.mjs        playwright-core: step the clock a frame, screenshot, repeat
```

`npm ci` in the copied skill is its documented install (its own lockfile); it
runs only inside the gitignored `.media/`.

## v5 (owner, 2026-11-01): "the earlier version was better, especially the start;
## this feels like a presentation, not a launch video; lower the music, let the
## haptics speak; scenes should show what is possible"

- **Opening**: v3's montage back, at 1× — six controls, 0.6 s each, hard-cut as
  each press lands (`data-media-start` puts the press 0.25 s into its clip).
- **Grid** replaces the static bento (owner: "a bunch of components in a grid
  moving in opposite directions, and it keeps zooming out to reveal more"):
  nine columns of live tiles, alternate columns sliding opposite ways, the
  camera pulling back exponentially from one input being typed into.
- **Showcase**: hard cuts on actions with camera pushes — the assemble, Settings
  across looks, Aero's Start, Linux's palette change, the agent typing and
  sending, Slang computing.
- **Words**: four lines on a ground band, none over the montage.
- **Mix**: score 0.28, haptics 0.9, mastered to −18 LUFS.

## v4.1 (owner, 2026-11-01): "static cuts, the sidebar collapse, and make the
## platform switch visible"

- **Opening**: four close-ups (Switch, Tabs, Slider, Checkbox) at 1.2 s each.
  Each shot is one static framing — the camera push is gone, so the cut is the
  only motion, and every press has ~0.7 s to settle before its cut.
- **Platforms**: each shot is named under the line (`macOS`, `Windows`,
  `Linux`) for exactly its own cut, so the switch is read, not inferred. The
  Settings take holds the macOS look for the shot (its Look presses moved to
  1.5 s / 2.4 s / 3.2 s of a 4 s take); Aero is Windows, the tiling block Linux.
- **Terminal**: the scene starts at the take's first frame — `ssh` typed at the
  local prompt, the login banner, `nub run dev console --terminal` typed, its
  output, then the app painting below the shell history. The take is pressed
  early (`deploy@0.5`) so its toasts are up, then the sidebar trigger
  (`sidebar-trigger@1.5`); the collapse and the toasts paint on the terminal's
  own repaint cadence, which is the whole ~2 s the platform gives it.
  Terminal mode only repaints on input (`terminal-take.ts` TODO), so the
  collapse is one painted frame, not a spring — the film shows it instead of
  cutting past it.
- **App shots**: the agent and Slang shots shrink to leave a bottom margin.
