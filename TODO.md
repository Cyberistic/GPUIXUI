# TODO.md — the persistent source of truth

This file is how work resumes after a context compaction, a restart, or a new
agent. Tick items as they finish. Add categories as plans land. If a task is not
here, add it and tick it. Implementation details do not belong here — only tasks
worth tracking.

---

## Phase A — audit and feasibility

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/6

`[ ]` Inspect the environment, package manager and toolchain; record the findings
`[ ]` Establish the GPUix version, APIs, primitives, events, layout and limits
`[ ]` Read GPUix docs and examples; write the capability map
`[ ]` Inspect GPUI Kit (hierarchy, theming, layout, interaction, licence)
`[ ]` Study shadcn/ui organisation and semantic tokens; review PanelUI; review Fumadocs setup
`[ ]` Write and index every phase and package plan in `.agents/slop/plans/`

## Phase B — working foundation

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/6

`[ ]` Land the workspace, boundaries and package scaffolding that has real content
`[ ]` Land tokens and the theming architecture (light + dark, semantic roles)
`[ ]` Land the primitives package
`[ ]` **Native smoke test**: layout, input, focus, overlay and panel primitives in real GPUix
`[ ]` Land one fully working component running in GPUix
`[ ]` Land the docs shell and document that component in Fumadocs

## Phase C — Tier 1–2 components

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/3

`[ ]` Tier 1 foundational components (code + test + example + docs + inventory)
`[ ]` Tier 2 composition/feedback components (same bar)
`[ ]` Verify every component in both themes

## Phase D — data and workspace components

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/3

`[ ]` Tier 3 data presentation
`[ ]` Tier 4 desktop workspace (panels, docking, tabs, command palette)
`[ ]` Verify critical interactions in the real runtime

## Phase E — specialised components

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/2

`[ ]` Tier 5 specialised components where justified
`[ ]` Document every capability GPUix does not provide, with evidence

## Phase F — integration and polish

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/3

`[ ]` Consistency, keyboard, themes, composability pass
`[ ]` Performance and packaging
`[ ]` Docs truth pass against the implementation

## Phase G — release readiness

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/3

`[ ]` Clean-environment install and public-export checks
`[ ]` Licence inventory and attribution complete
`[ ]` All gates green (`nub run check`, `nub run lint`, `nub run test`)

## Docs site workstream (plans 410–412)

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/8

`[x]` Write and index the docs-site plans (410, 411, 412)
`[ ]` Scaffold `apps/docs` (Fumadocs + TanStack Start, build + dev work)
`[ ]` Docs identity: light/dark themes from the tokens theme
`[ ]` Working search (server route + UI)
`[ ]` Information architecture pages (`content/docs/**`) + landing page
`[ ]` Component metadata contract, registry test, generated index (plan 411)
`[ ]` Preview components + `docs/preview-strategy.md` (plan 412)
`[ ]` Document the first real component page (needs the primitives/components workstream)

## Cross-team tasks raised by the docs-site workstream

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/7

`[ ]` Owner: hoist the `apps/docs` stack (fumadocs, tanstack, tailwind, vite) into the root catalog
`[-]` Repo tooling: oxfmt now ignores `**/.source/**` and `**/routeTree.gen.ts` (edited in this workstream)
`[ ]` Repo tooling: `.gitignore`'s `references/` does not match the worktree's `references` symlink, so it shows as untracked and can be committed by accident; ignore the symlink too
`[ ]` Tokens-theme: expose a dependency-free token data export the docs site can read for token tables
`[ ]` Components/primitives: export tsdoc-annotated props types the docs site can turn into API tables
`[ ]` Playground: add a per-component screen + a real native screenshot capture script (plan 412 §5)
`[ ]` Docs site: add `<ComponentSource>` (copyable real source) with the first real component page
