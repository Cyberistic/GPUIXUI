# TODO.md — the persistent source of truth

This file is how work resumes after a context compaction, a restart, or a new
agent. Tick items as they finish. Add categories as plans land. If a task is not
here, add it and tick it. Implementation details do not belong here — only tasks
worth tracking.

## Harness — the supervisor that keeps the swarm alive

`[x]` `[█████████░]` 6/7

`[x]` Repo on `proserver` with the required shape, mission, rules and plan index
`[x]` opencode 2.0.31 installed with the provider credentials and a trimmed config
`[x]` Verified a real run on `opencode-go-braven/deepseek-v4.1-flash`
`[x]` Supervisor: 30-minute tick, ≥5 agents, one worktree each, idempotent and crash-safe
`[x]` Scheduler installed (launchd agent + daemon driver; see `.agents/slop/README.md`)
`[x]` Model fallback chain with limit detection, one active model for the whole swarm, and an hourly recovery probe (see `scripts/README.md`)
`[ ]` Enforce one live session per worktree: the `opencode run` loop currently
starts a new session before the previous one closes (evidence:
`.agents/slop/blockers/2026-10-17-concurrent-tokens-writers.md`; the guard is
planned in `primitives` plan 022, `022-swarm-single-writer.md`)

---

## Phase A — audit and feasibility

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/6

`[ ]` Inspect the environment, package manager and toolchain; record the findings
`[ ]` Establish the GPUix version, APIs, primitives, events, layout and limits
`[ ]` Read GPUix docs and examples; write the capability map
`[ ]` Inspect GPUI Kit (hierarchy, theming, layout, interaction, licence)
`[ ]` Study shadcn/ui organisation and semantic tokens; review PanelUI; review Fumadocs setup
`[ ]` Write and index every phase and package plan in `.agents/slop/plans/`

## Phase B — working foundation

`[x]` `[██░░░░░░░░]` 1/6

`[ ]` Land the workspace, boundaries and package scaffolding that has real content
`[x]` Land tokens and the theming architecture (light + dark, semantic roles)
`[ ]` Land the primitives package
`[ ]` **Native smoke test**: layout, input, focus, overlay and panel primitives in real GPUix
`[ ]` Land one fully working component running in GPUix
`[ ]` Land the docs shell and document that component in Fumadocs

### Design tokens and theming (`tokens-theme`)

`[x]` `[███████░░░]` 14/20

`[x]` Write and index the tokens/theme plan set (plans 010–019 and 051)
`[x]` Implement `packages/tokens`: semantic colour roles, typography, spacing,
radii, density, elevation, light + dark themes
`[x]` Implement the theme extension mechanism (`createTheme`/`extendTheme`) and
the `@gpuixui/tokens/react` provider
`[x]` Add high-contrast (AAA) light and dark themes (`getTheme(mode, "high")`)
`[x]` Add status tone roles plus `alpha` and `statusTone` helpers
`[x]` Expose `colorRoles` for the docs site's generated token tables
`[x]` Make `@gpuixui/tokens` resolvable from source so a clean checkout needs no
prebuilt `dist` (plan 016)
`[x]` Ship `focusRing(theme)` and correct the focus claims in `docs/tokens.md` and
`docs/design-system.md` — GPUix 0.10.0 has no `outline*` and no `focusVisible`
(plan 017)
`[x]` Drop `BoxShadow.inset`, document the one-shadow rule and hoist
`elevationShadow(theme, level)` (plan 018)
`[x]` Write `docs/tokens.md` (every token + extension API)
`[x]` Write `docs/design-system.md` (identity, roles, state, accessibility)
`[x]` Add platform type styles and `platformTheme(theme, platform)` for the docs
platform toggle (plan 051)
`[x]` Add the design-system rows to `COMPONENTS.md`
`[ ]` Add motion tokens (durations/easings) once a component consumes them
`[ ]` Ship `registerFonts` so a consumer's (or the library's) typeface reaches the
runtime, and record the licence review for any bundled family — plan 052, native
proof blocked by B1 (rescued from the abandoned `agent/fonts` branch)
`[ ]` Cross-team: native theme gallery in `apps/playground` (owner:
`playground`; blocked by B1); Fumadocs Theming page from `docs/tokens.md` and the
docs platform toggle (macOS / Linux / Windows / Default) built on
`platformTypes` + `platformTheme` (owner: `docs-site`); ignore the `references`
**symlink** — a `references/` rule does not match a symlink, so every worktree
shows it as untracked (owner: repo tooling; `packages/README.md` already lists
`tokens`)
`[x]` Components consume `@gpuixui/tokens` directly: the local `withAlpha`,
`focusRing`, `elevation` and hand-mixed `tone` palette are gone; `internal/theme.ts`
re-exports the token helpers and keeps only the `danger` → `destructive` mapping
(plan 157)
`[ ]` Cross-team: `primitives` still carries its local focus-ring and
first-shadow helpers (`primitives/src/core/style.ts`) — delete them now that
`focusRing` and `elevationShadow` are in tokens (owner: `primitives`; plan 157
records the components half)
`[x]` Components carry no structural copy of `@gpuixui/tokens` and import the
package directly (plan 157)
`[!]` Tokens' `src/react.tsx` is compiled inside the components program when
tokens resolves from source; the isolated linker puts `@gpuix/react` only under
`packages/components/node_modules`, so components' `tsconfig.json` maps the JSX
runtime to its own dependency. The durable fix is a tokens-side
`@gpuix/react` devDependency or an `@jsxImportSource react` pragma (owner:
tokens-theme — do not edit from this workstream)
`[x]` Promote the workstream to `main`: plans 010–019 and 051, `packages/tokens`
and the union plan index are on `main` (commit `458fe10`); `main` now compiles
`@gpuixui/tokens` from source, so `primitives`, `components` and `docs-site` can
merge it and drop their structural copies
`[ ]` Merge `main` into `agent/tokens-theme` once plan 019 (motion tokens) lands
there, then promote that commit — `agent/tokens-platform` is a second branch for
this workstream, created because two live sessions shared one worktree (see
`.agents/slop/blockers/2026-10-17-concurrent-tokens-writers.md`), and should be
retired once both branches are one

## Phase C — Tier 1–2 components

`[~]` `[███░░░░░░░]` 2/3

`[~]` Tier 1 foundational components (code + test + example + docs + inventory):
      all 19 components have code, tests, a runtime-verified interaction, an
      in-package docs page, a mounted example and an inventory row; **docs-site
      pages are still pending** (docs-site workstream)
`[x]` Tier 2 composition/feedback components (same bar)
  - [x] Write and index the Tier 2 plan set (plans 110–119)
  - [x] `packages/components` package, token/primitives adapters, native test harness
    - [x] Package scaffold (package.json, tsconfig, vitest config, README)
    - [x] `internal/collection.ts` (index arithmetic), `internal/key.ts` (key predicates)
    - [x] `internal/theme.ts` adapter over the landed token API (plan 110 §6) — the tokens workstream is merged into this branch
    - [x] `runtime.test.tsx` — the renderer guard (plan 117 §5b): a lifted dynamic import decides `available` / `unsupported-host` / `missing`, and fails on a supported host. Proven to fail by adding this host to `supportedHosts`.
    - [x] `internal/test-root.tsx` (`renderComponent`) — renders under a theme; runs here now that the native binding loads
    - [x] `internal/a11y.ts` — the accessibility dump normalised for assertions (role case, `value` vs `label`)
    - [x] Behaviour suites under a second config (`src/behaviour/`, `test:behaviour`): a static GPUix import fails to *load* on an unsupported host, so `describe.skipIf` cannot gate them (plan 117 §5a/§5c). **The split stays**: the suites now run here, on hosts with a binding
  - [x] Foundation parts: Card, Badge, Avatar, Alert, EmptyState, List (plan 111)
    - [x] `internal/collection.ts` (List single-selection core, shared with Tabs/menus)
    - [x] Card: `src/card.tsx`, behaviour suite, example, docs page, inventory record — **verified natively** (5/5, `nub run --filter @gpuixui/components test:behaviour`)
    - [x] Badge: `src/badge.tsx` + `toneSurface` in the theme seam, behaviour suite (7/7), example, docs page, inventory record
    - [x] Avatar: `src/avatar.tsx` + `src/avatar/logic.ts` (unicode-safe initials), behaviour suite (7/7) + logic suite (8), example, docs page, inventory record
    - [x] Alert: `src/alert.tsx`, behaviour suite (10/10, real click + keyboard), example, docs page, inventory record — the dismiss control is `internal/button.tsx`
    - [x] Local button stand-in: `src/internal/button.tsx` (`Button`, `IconButton`), behaviour suite (9/9); plan 110 §7 amended
    - [x] EmptyState: `src/empty-state.tsx`, behaviour suite (6/6), example, docs page, inventory record
    - [x] List / ListItem: `src/list.tsx` over `internal/collection.ts`, behaviour suite (12/12: real focus, wrap over disabled rows, controlled), example, docs page, inventory record
  - [x] Overlays: Dialog, Confirmation dialog, Popover
    - [x] Plan 112 §1/§1b re-measured against 0.10.0 and corrected: there is **no** `Dialog`, `DismissableLayer`, `pushDismissLayer` or `anchored fill="window"`, so the overlays are local implementations over host elements
    - [x] Plan 112 §1b's five overlay probes answered and recorded in plan 112 §1c — the veil must be an `<anchored position={{x:0,y:0}}>`, because `position:"absolute"` resolves against the mount parent; `focusNextWithin` wraps; a focused `tabIndex={-1}` node receives keys
    - [x] `internal/dismiss-layer.ts` (topmost-layer-wins, one event consumes one layer) + `dialog.tsx` (+ 5 logic tests, 12 native behaviour tests)
    - [x] `confirm-dialog.tsx` — Cancel-first, caller-owned close, loading locks both dismissals (+ 5 native behaviour tests)
    - [x] `popover.tsx` — `FloatingLayer` anchoring, Escape restores focus, Tab/outside press do not, mouse-down re-open guard (+ 8 native behaviour tests, both themes)
    - [x] Examples, docs pages and inventory rows for Dialog, Confirmation dialog and Popover
    - [x] Plans 112/113 reference `keyboardFocusDim` and `focusVisible`, which 0.10.0's `StyleDesc` does not have — corrected in the plans before any overlay style was written
    - [x] `StyleDesc` has per-side border *widths* but a single `borderColor`; a separator that needs its own colour uses a 1px `div` or `borderColor` (as `CardFooter` does). Plan 111's footer row uses `borderColor`.
    - [x] Plan 112's `DialogContent` names the surface through `aria-label` only (0.10.0 has no `aria-labelledby`; verified in `AnchoredProps`/`HostProps`)
  - [x] Disclosure and navigation: Tabs, Accordion, Collapsible, Breadcrumb, Pagination (plan 113)
    - [x] Logic: `accordion/logic.ts`, `breadcrumb/logic.ts`, `pagination/logic.ts`, `tabs/logic.ts`
    - [x] `tabs.tsx` + 8 native behaviour tests (automatic/manual activation, wrap, disabled, controlled)
    - [x] `collapsible.tsx` + 4 native behaviour tests (unmounts while closed, Enter/Space, controlled)
    - [x] `accordion.tsx` + 8 native behaviour tests (single/multiple, collapsible, disabled, null close)
    - [x] `breadcrumb.tsx` + 5 native behaviour tests (collapse keeps the ends, separators follow their item)
    - [x] `pagination.tsx` + 8 native behaviour tests (edges, current page no-op, both themes)
    - [x] Examples, docs pages and inventory rows for all five
  - [x] Menus: Dropdown, Context, Command (plan 114)
    - [x] Logic: `menu/logic.ts` over the shared collection
    - [x] `menu/state.ts` + `menu/item.tsx` + `menu/surface.tsx` (the shared row registry, highlight-follows-focus, menu keyboard rules)
    - [x] `dropdown-menu.tsx`, behaviour suite (9/9), example, docs page, inventory row
    - [x] `context-menu.tsx` on `onAuxClick` + `isRightClick` and an `anchored` surface at the pointer (6/6), example, docs, inventory
    - [x] `command-menu.tsx` composing Dialog + the shared row look; input keeps focus, Enter arrives as `submit` (8/8), example, docs, inventory
  - [x] Choice inputs: Search input, Combobox (plan 116)
    - [x] Logic: `combobox/logic.ts` (ranking + selection)
    - [x] `search-input.tsx` + 6 native behaviour tests (typing, clear + focus, Enter, Escape once, controlled)
    - [x] `combobox.tsx` wrapping GPUix's headless combobox with pre-ranked items; 10 native behaviour tests (ranking, value payload, single/multiple, disabled, Escape)
    - [x] Examples, docs pages and inventory rows for both
  - [x] Feedback: Toast system, inline validation (`Field`)
    - [x] `toast/model.ts` + test (the `ToastInput` boundary type and the queued `Toast`)
    - [x] `toast/store.ts` + test (queue, monotonic ids, `FiberMap` timers, `TestClock`)
    - [x] `validation/logic.ts` + test (`validate` / `validateAll` over schema issues)
    - [x] `toast/provider.tsx` + `viewport.tsx` + `toast.tsx` (ManagedRuntime boundary, `useToast`, viewport) + 7 native behaviour tests
    - [x] `field.tsx` (Field/FieldLabel/FieldDescription/FieldError/FieldInput) + 5 native behaviour tests
    - [x] Examples, docs pages and inventory rows for Toast and Field
  - [x] Date / time picker (plan 119) — the day picker is done; a time picker is documented as out of scope
  - [x] Tier 2 verification matrix and inventory sync check (plan 117)
    - [x] `src/inventory.ts` + `src/inventory.test.ts`: files exist, rows agree, no duplicates, `done` implies a behaviour test
    - [x] `src/behaviour/theme-matrix.test.tsx`: the both-theme matrix for the 11 components without one
    - [x] Six records corrected from `gpuixSupport: "yes"` to `partial` where the runtime lacks the ARIA surface or a keyboard path
  - Tier 2 hardening after the inventory closed (plans 120+)
    - [x] List multiple selection (`selectionMode="multiple"`, modifiers, range) and the duplicate `COMPONENTS.md` row — plan 120
    - [x] Accordion arrow/Home/End movement between headers — plan 121
    - [x] Context menu Shift+F10 opening and focus return — plan 122
    - [x] Toast pause-on-hover with remaining-time resume — plan 123
    - [x] Toast hold on keyboard focus, composed with hover — plan 124
    - [x] List select-all (`Cmd`/`Ctrl`+A) over enabled rows — plan 125
    - [x] Dropdown menu keyboard opening lands on the first/last row — plan 126
    - [x] Date picker `min`/`max` bounds and a clear action — plan 127
    - [x] Trigger parts merge the caller's ref with their internal one (found by plan 127)
    - [x] Every part that owns a ref composes the caller's too — plan 128
    - [x] Menu type-ahead (`DropdownMenu`/`ContextMenu`) — plan 129
    - [x] List type-ahead over the shared type-ahead core — plan 130
    - [x] Dropdown menu submenus — plan 131
    - [x] Time picker, the time half of the date/time item — plan 132
    - [x] Command menu fuzzy matching and in-group ranking — plan 133
    - [x] List row activation on Enter and click — plan 134
    - [x] Submenu pointer activation and ContextMenu submenus — plan 135
    - [x] SearchInput ref and TabsTrigger onBlur forwarding — plan 136
    - [x] ListItem caller `onClick` forwarding — plan 137
    - [x] Combobox pointer selection coverage — plan 138
    - [x] Inventory test counts and the drifted rows — plan 139
    - [x] Tabs vertical orientation verified: axis keys, layout and manual activation — plan 321
    - [x] Toast actions: one labelled action with a provider-owned handler — plan 322
    - [x] Floating placement truth: compensate `align="center"` from the measured
      panel and flip a snapped surface off its trigger — plan 323 (evidence:
      plan 156 §8; `PopoverContent`/`DropdownMenuContent` promised a runtime
      flip that 0.10.0 does not provide)
    - [x] Cross-team: handle the playground's measured floating defects
      (`align="center"` off by half the panel; `fit="snap"` clamping over the
      trigger) in `PopoverContent`, `DropdownMenuContent` and
      `ComboboxContent` — plan 323; 6 new native tests, both-direction proof
    - [x] Adopt `@gpuixui/icons` for every component-owned fixed mark:
      close/dismiss, search and clear, chevrons, check marks and the toast tone
      glyph — plan 324; 451 native behaviour tests, both-direction proof, docs
      and inventory sync
    - [x] Navigation menu hover-open over one shared hover-travel policy
      (`internal/hover.ts`, also used by PreviewCard): `openOnHover`,
      `openDelay`, `closeDelay`, pointer travel into the panel, no focus theft,
      disabled triggers never open — plan 325; 7 new native tests (458 total),
      both-direction proof
    - [x] Behaviour teardown: a failed assertion no longer leaks the native root
      and reports four phantom failures — plan 326; `afterEach` teardown, a
      two-test harness proof, one wrong assertion now reports one failure
      (460 behaviour tests)
    - [x] Behaviour timing robustness under a loaded host — plan 327;
      condition-based waits in the hover suites, a 20 s native budget, and
      preview-card's 8 tests green three runs in a row
    - [x] Combobox create-new option: one trailing row over the typed query,
      single/multi selection, no sentinel leak — plan 328; 6 logic + 6 native
      tests, both-direction proof (behaviour 487)
  - Reference adoption
    - [x] 200 — adopt `base-gpui`'s compound-part contract as the Tier 1–2 API spec: `docs/component-api.md`, ADR 0004, `LICENSES/base-gpui.md`, `PLAN.md` D25 and a contract check in `inventory.test.ts` (plan 200; proven to fail by changing one translation row)
    - [x] 201 (components half) — `core/runtime.ts` (`createRuntime`: initial/reduce/query/run), its pure test, the `docs/component-api.md` §7 state-model section, ADR 0005 and PLAN.md D26 (plan 201; both-direction proof: deleting the select branch fails the fold test)
    - [ ] 201 (shared helper) — `packages/testing/src/state.ts` + its test (`runCommands` over a runtime), so suites outside `packages/components` replay commands (owner: playground; this package's `runtime.run` is the same fold)
    - [x] Split Alert into parts — `Alert`, `AlertIcon`, `AlertContent`, `AlertTitle`, `AlertDescription`, `AlertDismiss` over a tone context; 11 native tests; docs, example and API table updated (plan 158)
    - [x] Split the remaining landed deviations named in `docs/component-api.md` §9 into parts — each with its own behaviour test, docs update and inventory row (owner: components). Plans 300–303 are landed.
      - [x] Pagination parts — plan 300
      - [x] CommandMenu parts — plan 301
      - [x] Combobox parts — plan 302
      - [x] DatePicker + TimePicker parts — plan 303
    - [x] Typed-by-position children — plan 304: `PartChildren` (elements/conditionals, never text) plus a family-scoped render check on 32 parents; part identity cannot be a compile error in React 19's JSX types, recorded in `docs/component-api.md` §1 (owner: components)
    - [x] Expose `style` as `StateStyle<PartState>` on the interactive parts — plan 305: 11 parts with exported state types; button-shaped triggers stay on the local stand-in until `@gpuixui/primitives` owns it (owner: components)
    - [ ] `packages/primitives` adopts the same contract for Tier 1 (a parts table row is the spec; the package is owned by primitives) (owner: primitives)
  - Tier 2 gap rows (plan 205; each row gets its own plan before implementation)
    - [x] Write and index plans 309–320 for the twelve remaining gap rows
    - [x] Fieldset — plan 306: groups fields, propagates `disabled` to `FieldInput` (7 native tests; both-direction proof)
    - [x] Stepper — plan 307: read-only multi-step indicator, statuses derived from `value` (8 native tests; both-direction proof)
    - [x] Form — plan 308: owned-value schema validation, one alert summary, decoded `onSubmit`, pending guard (7 native tests; both-direction proof)
    - [x] Drawer — plan 309: 10 native tests; the modal rules extracted from Dialog, whose 18 tests re-pass
    - [x] Keyboard shortcuts / keycap display — plan 310 (owns the accelerator model): 10 accelerator tests + 6 native tests; both-direction proof
    - [x] Timeline — plan 311: 6 native tests; both-direction proof
    - [x] Countdown — plan 312: 9 formatting tests + 5 native tests
    - [x] Inline edit — plan 313: 8 native tests; both-direction proof
    - [x] Tag / token input — plan 314: 10 rule + 8 native tests; both-direction proof
    - [x] Carousel — plan 315: 8 native tests; both-direction proof
    - [x] Hotkey-recorder input — plan 316 (consumes plan 310): 8 capture + 8 native tests; both-direction proof
    - [x] Preview Card — plan 317: 8 native tests; delay, pointer travel and Escape proven
    - [x] Color picker — plan 318 (discrete swatches: 0.10.0 has no gradients): 8 hex + 8 native tests; both-direction proof
    - [x] Mention input — plan 319: 12 rule + 9 native tests; both-direction proof
    - [x] Navigation Menu — plan 320: 6 parts, 10 native tests; both-direction proof
    - [x] Message scroller — plan 206: pinned follow over a 1px tail sentinel, no yank when scrolled up, unread count, jump-to-latest, streamed growth; 11 rule + 10 native tests + 1 theme-matrix case; both-direction proof (behaviour 437, unit 296). Non-virtualized viewport recorded as the limitation (`<virtual-list>` takes an item count, not compound children)
    - [x] AI conversation — plan 207: `Message` (variants + avatar/content/reasoning/tool calls/sources/attachments/streaming/actions) and `Chat` (transcript + composer + status union); 10 + 9 native behaviour tests, 10 transition tests, both-theme rows; credit on both docs pages, `LICENSES/` interlock recorded
    - [x] Tier 2 gap cluster complete: all twelve landed with code, a native test, an example, a docs page and an inventory row; after plan 206 the suite is behaviour 437, unit 296
`[x]` Verify every component in both themes

## Blockers (project-level, with evidence)

`[x]` **The GPUix native runtime now loads on this machine, so the Tier 2 behaviour
suites run here.** Resolved 2026-10-17 08:57 by plan `140` (playground workstream):
`@gpuix/native@0.10.0` publishes no `darwin-x64` binary, so the pinned source was
built locally with `gpui_macos/runtime_shaders` (which removes the build-time
`xcrun metal` dependency) and the resulting `gpuix-native.darwin-x64.node` is in
the store, hard-linked across worktrees. Verified from `packages/components`:
`nub run --filter @gpuixui/components test:behaviour` runs the real
`TestRenderer` and Card's suite passes 5/5.

Evidence, 2026-10-17 (the failure this replaced): `uname -m` → `x86_64`;
`@gpuix/native@0.10.0` published only `-darwin-arm64`, `-linux-x64-gnu`,
`-win32-x64-msvc`; loading it failed with `mach-o file, but is an incompatible
architecture (have 'arm64', need 'x86_64')`.

Still true and worth remembering:

- The `wasm` build exports only `GpuixRenderer`, not `TestGpuixRenderer`.
- The binding is a **locally built artifact**, not a published one: a clean
  `nub install` on a bare host still has none, so the behaviour suites stay out
  of the default `test` run (plan 117 §5a–§5c) and a host without a binding
  reports `unsupported-host` from `src/runtime.test.tsx`.
- On an Apple-silicon Mac, Linux x64 or Windows x64 the published binding works
  with no local build.

`[x]` **nub's isolated linker does not install optional platform binaries of
transitive dependencies.** `@gpuix/native-darwin-arm64` (an optional dependency
of `@gpuix/native`) was absent from the store entry; `nub install --node-linker
hoisted` links it. Superseded on this host: the store now carries a locally built
`darwin-x64` binding (first entry above), hard-linked across worktrees.

`[x]` **Two sessions wrote this worktree at once — B3, resolved 2026-10-17
08:56.** Root cause and permanent fix: plan `022-swarm-single-writer.md`
(primitives worktree). Measurement for this worktree: plan
`118-single-writer-components.md`, which also records the resolution: the stale
turn `ses_eb7f09666ffeRRbJxPz0d344Cw` (07:12) committed and pushed everything it
produced and stood down, because the rotating `run-components.sh` turn is the one
the supervisor can see and replace. Re-verified at 08:56 and again at 09:00: the
`session_v2` count is `1`, and the tree is clean apart from the untracked
`nub.lock` and `references` symlink. The permanent fix — pinning `--session` and
teaching `agent_alive` to count live server-side sessions (plan 022 §5) — is
still the coordinator's, in `scripts/`.

`[!]` **`@gpuix/react@0.10.0` (the latest published release) is far behind the
reference clone in `~/GPUIXUI/references/gpuix`.** Verified against the installed
package, 2026-10-17:

| Surface | Reference clone | installed 0.10.0 |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| `KeyEvent` type, `preventDefault`, `defaultPrevented` | yes | **no** — handlers receive `EventPayload` |
| `Button`, `buttonProps` | yes | **no** |
| `Dialog` + parts, `DialogPortal/Backdrop/Popup` | yes | **no** |
| `DismissableLayer`, `pushDismissLayer`, layer stack, focus restore | yes | **no** |
| `FloatingLayer`, `renderSlot`, `useControllableState`, `mergeStyles` | yes | yes, via `@gpuix/react/floating` |
| `Select` + parts, `Combobox` + parts, `Tooltip` + parts | yes | yes |
| `motion`, `AnimatePresence` | yes | yes |

Consequences for Tier 2: Escape dismissal, layer stacking, focus-in/out and
Tab trapping must be implemented in this package on top of `renderer.focusElement`
/ `focusNextWithin` / `focusPreviousWithin` and element-level `onKeyDown`, instead
of relying on the clone's `DismissableLayer`. `Button`/`buttonProps` and
`Dialog` parts must be equivalent local implementations over `<div>` + host props
until `packages/primitives` and a newer `@gpuix/react` land. Plans 110 §1/§7 and
112/114 have been corrected for this.

Related: the reference clone must not be treated as the API of the pinned
dependency anywhere in this repo, and `package.json` pins must stay explicit.

`[!]` **Two sessions write this worktree at once — B3, still live** (measured
2026-10-17 08:47). Root cause and permanent fix: plan
`022-swarm-single-writer.md` (primitives worktree). Measurement for this
worktree: plan `118-single-writer-components.md`. Two live top-level sessions
hold `workspaces/components` at the same time —
`ses_eb7f09666ffeRRbJxPz0d344Cw` (07:12:12, a stale turn from an earlier tick)
and `ses_eb7a7c3edffeSehcVqeqHJEsYa` (08:31:44, the current `run-components.sh`
turn). `run-components.sh` starts a new `opencode run` session every iteration
and does not own the turn, so a turn that outlives its CLI call keeps writing
while the loop starts another on top of it; `agent_alive` only checks the runner
pid, so the supervisor cannot see the duplicate. Between 08:40 and 08:47 the tree
gained `card.tsx`, `behaviour/card.test.tsx`, `docs/card.mdx`,
`examples/card.example.tsx` and the commits `7786193`, `f424b1e`, `ab000ab` —
none authored by the supervisor's session. **Response:** this workstream stopped
writing component code the moment the duplicate was confirmed, restoring the
one-writer invariant; the one clean non-overlapping commit (`22f706c`, the
status-tone palette) is preserved. No session was deleted — that is the
coordinator's call and would discard the stale session's in-flight work (plan
022 §4/§7). Resume `packages/components` only when the plan 118 §5 check prints
`1` twice. **Re-measured 08:54:** the pair rotates — `ses_eb7a7c3e…` went idle and
`ses_eb795d97…` took its place while the stale turn stayed live — so the count
stays `2` and the condition **cannot** be met by agent discipline; it needs plan
022 §5's pinned-session fix (coordinator, `scripts/`). Component code stays
paused on a green, pushed `HEAD`; plan 118 carries the measurement.

## Interlocks (cross-workstream dependencies)

Work that this workstream needs but does not own. Another agent owns each row.

| Need | Owner | Status |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| `@gpuixui/tokens` roles in plan 110 §6 | tokens-theme | **resolved** — the workstream is merged into `agent/components`; `internal/theme.ts` is the seam over it |
| Serialise writers per worktree: a second live session writes `packages/components` alongside the supervisor's; root cause in plan `022` (primitives), this worktree's measurement in plan `118` | repo tooling (`scripts/`) | **resolved in this worktree** 2026-10-17 (the stale turn stood down; the tree has read one writer since); the permanent `scripts/` fix (plan 022 §5) is still pending |
| Decide the GPUix version: stay on 0.10.0 and implement dismiss layers/focus locally, or ship a release that includes `Dialog`/`Button`/`DismissableLayer` (0.10.0 is the latest published) | owner / playground | pending |
| Soft tone pair per status (`info`, `infoSoft`, `successSoft`, `warningSoft`, `destructiveSoft` + readable foregrounds) | tokens-theme | **resolved** — landed on `main`; `internal/theme.ts` consumes `statusTone` (plan 157) |
| `alpha(color, amount)` helper | tokens-theme | **resolved** — landed on `main`; the local `withAlpha` is deleted (plan 157) |
| An `info` status role so Alert/Badge/Toast stop borrowing `accent` | tokens-theme | **resolved** — `infoSoft`/`infoSoftForeground` are the tone's roles (plan 157) |
| `@gpuixui/tokens`' React file compiles with this package's `jsxImportSource`; tokens cannot resolve `@gpuix/react` under the isolated linker | tokens-theme | pending — worked around in `packages/components/tsconfig.json` `paths`; durable fix is a tokens devDependency or pragma |
| `packages/testing/src/state.ts` + test: `runCommands(runtime, commands)` for suites outside this package (plan 201) | playground | pending — `runtime.run` in `packages/components` is the same fold meanwhile |
| An avatar diameter scale (20/26/32/40) so `DIAMETER` in `avatar.tsx` can be deleted | tokens-theme | pending |
| `@gpuixui/primitives` exports in plan 110 §7 | primitives | pending — **blocking nothing meanwhile**: `internal/button.tsx` is the local `Button`/`IconButton` stand-in (plan 110 §7 amendment), to be deleted when the package lands |
| A `primaryHover` / `destructiveHover` role pair so filled buttons stop using a half-alpha fill for hover | tokens-theme | pending |
| Playground mounts the Tier 2 examples and runs a dialog/menu/toast smoke | playground | pending |
| Docs site renders `packages/components/docs/*.mdx` and the example registry | docs-site | pending |
| `scripts/verify-two-directions.sh` uses `jj`, which is not installed (D1) | tooling | pending |
| Decide whether `nub.lock` is committed: it is currently untracked and regenerated per worktree, so every workstream's copy would conflict | tooling | **resolved** — master tracks `nub.lock`; the merge took master's committed copy |
| `LICENSES/`: record GPUI Kit = Apache-2.0 (+ CC BY 4.0 for its docs prose, Lucide ISC for icons, no NOTICE file); shadcn/ui is referenced as design inspiration only, not copied source. The Message Scroller behaviour port (MIT) needs its own `provenance.md` row (plan 206 credits it on the docs page) | licensing | pending |
| `LICENSES/`: credit shadcn/ui AI Elements `chat` + `message` (MIT) for plan 207's behaviour port; both docs pages already credit it in prose | licensing | pending |

## Swarm-owned blockers (fix these)

- **B1** GPUix native bindings fail to install (blocks the playground + every native smoke test).
- **B2** No durable scheduler — the swarm runs on a detached daemon; launchd and cron do not fire here.

Both are specified in ; each fix starts with a plan under .

- **Docs: platform toggle (macOS / Linux / Windows / Default)** — every component preview switches platform style; the styles are real editable token themes in packages/tokens, not docs-only CSS (see MISSION.md).
