# TODO.md — the persistent source of truth

This file is how work resumes after a context compaction, a restart, or a new
agent. Tick items as they finish. Add categories as plans land. If a task is not
here, add it and tick it. Implementation details do not belong here — only tasks
worth tracking.

## Harness — the supervisor that keeps the swarm alive

`[x]` `[█████████░]` 6/7

`[x]` Repo on `proserver` with the required shape, mission, rules and plan index
`[x]` opencode 2.0.31 installed with the provider credentials and a trimmed config
`[x]` Verified a real run on `opencode-go-braven/deepseek-v4.1-flash`
`[x]` Supervisor: 30-minute tick, ≥5 agents, one worktree each, idempotent and crash-safe
`[x]` Scheduler installed (launchd agent + daemon driver; see `.agents/slop/README.md`)
`[x]` Model fallback chain with limit detection, one active model for the whole swarm, and an hourly recovery probe (see `scripts/README.md`)
`[ ]` Enforce one live session per worktree: the `opencode run` loop currently
starts a new session before the previous one closes (evidence:
`.agents/slop/blockers/2026-10-17-concurrent-tokens-writers.md`; the guard is
planned in `primitives` plan 022, `022-swarm-single-writer.md`)

---

## Phase A — audit and feasibility

`[~]` `[███░░░░░░░]` 3/7

`[x]` Inspect the environment, package manager and toolchain; record the findings
`[x]` Establish the GPUix version, APIs, primitives, events, layout and limits
`[x]` Read GPUix docs and examples; write the capability map
`[~]` Inspect GPUI Kit (hierarchy, theming, layout, interaction, licence)
`[ ]` Study shadcn/ui organisation and semantic tokens; review PanelUI; review Fumadocs setup
`[~]` Write and index every phase and package plan in `.agents/slop/plans/`
`[!]` **BLOCKER: no GPUix runtime can run on this machine.** Intel macOS + no
      `darwin-x64` native binary + no Aqua session (SSH background). Evidence and
      the three honest ways out are in
      `.agents/slop/plans/020-gpuix-runtime-capability.md` §3. Owned by
      playground workstream (wasm path) with a human decision for the GUI path.
`[!]` **BLOCKER B3: several live agents are writing the same worktree.** Measured
      2026-10-17 07:40: 5 live `swarm:primitives` sessions (and 2–6 for every
      other workstream) editing `workspaces/primitives` concurrently, clobbering
      each other's files. `scripts/swarm-supervisor.sh`'s runner loops
      `opencode run` without a session id, so each CLI return leaves a live turn
      and starts another. Evidence, mitigation and the fix:
      `.agents/slop/plans/022-swarm-single-writer.md`. Fix lives in `scripts/`
      (shared checkout) — needs a coordinator or the human.
      **Update 2026-10-17 08:40:** the primitives tree is back to one writer —
      the duplicate session was removed (§4) after the tree was committed, and
      the tree then went green (`nub run check`, 133 + 18 tests). The runner
      **still forks a new session per loop iteration**, so every workstream will
      re-acquire a duplicate until §5.1 lands in the shared `scripts/`.

## Phase B — working foundation

`[~]` `[███░░░░░░░]` 3/6

`[ ]` Land the workspace, boundaries and package scaffolding that has real content
`[x]` Land tokens and the theming architecture (light + dark, semantic roles)
`[x]` Land the primitives package
`[ ]` **Native smoke test**: layout, input, focus, overlay and panel primitives in real GPUix
`[x]` Land one fully working component running in GPUix — all 19 Tier 1
      components mount in the real `TestRenderer` (plan 041; 70 runtime tests)
`[ ]` Land the docs shell and document that component in Fumadocs

### Design tokens and theming (`tokens-theme`)

`[x]` `[███████░░░]` 14/20

`[x]` Write and index the tokens/theme plan set (plans 010–019 and 051)
`[x]` Implement `packages/tokens`: semantic colour roles, typography, spacing,
radii, density, elevation, light + dark themes
`[x]` Implement the theme extension mechanism (`createTheme`/`extendTheme`) and
the `@gpuixui/tokens/react` provider
`[x]` Add high-contrast (AAA) light and dark themes (`getTheme(mode, "high")`)
`[x]` Add status tone roles plus `alpha` and `statusTone` helpers
`[x]` Expose `colorRoles` for the docs site's generated token tables
`[x]` Make `@gpuixui/tokens` resolvable from source so a clean checkout needs no
prebuilt `dist` (plan 016)
`[x]` Ship `focusRing(theme)` and correct the focus claims in `docs/tokens.md` and
`docs/design-system.md` — GPUix 0.10.0 has no `outline*` and no `focusVisible`
(plan 017)
`[x]` Drop `BoxShadow.inset`, document the one-shadow rule and hoist
`elevationShadow(theme, level)` (plan 018)
`[x]` Write `docs/tokens.md` (every token + extension API)
`[x]` Write `docs/design-system.md` (identity, roles, state, accessibility)
`[x]` Add platform type styles and `platformTheme(theme, platform)` for the docs
platform toggle (plan 051)
`[x]` Add the design-system rows to `COMPONENTS.md`
`[ ]` Add motion tokens (durations/easings) once a component consumes them
`[ ]` Ship `registerFonts` so a consumer's (or the library's) typeface reaches the
runtime, and record the licence review for any bundled family — plan 052, native
proof blocked by B1 (rescued from the abandoned `agent/fonts` branch)
`[ ]` Cross-team: native theme gallery in `apps/playground` (owner:
`playground`; blocked by B1); Fumadocs Theming page from `docs/tokens.md` and the
docs platform toggle (macOS / Linux / Windows / Default) built on
`platformTypes` + `platformTheme` (owner: `docs-site`); ignore the `references`
**symlink** — a `references/` rule does not match a symlink, so every worktree
shows it as untracked (owner: repo tooling; `packages/README.md` already lists
`tokens`)
`[ ]` Cross-team: `primitives` and `components` depend on `@gpuixui/tokens`
directly and delete their structural copies of the theme and role list, their
local focus-ring helpers (`primitives/src/core/style.ts`,
`components/src/internal/theme.ts`) and their first-shadow helpers
(`primitives/src/core/style.ts` `firstShadow`, `components/src/internal/theme.ts`
`elevation`), now that `focusRing` and `elevationShadow` exist and the package
resolves from source (owner: those workstreams; plans 016–018).
**Primitives half done** in plan 021 (`Theme` re-export, `focusRing`,
`elevationShadow`); `components` is still outstanding.
`[ ]` Cross-team: `components` still carries a whole structural copy of the
package (`packages/components/packages/tokens/src`, plus a built `dist/`) — delete
it and import `@gpuixui/tokens` directly once the package is on `main` (owner:
`components`)
`[x]` Promote the workstream to `main`: plans 010–019 and 051, `packages/tokens`
and the union plan index are on `main` (commit `458fe10`); `main` now compiles
`@gpuixui/tokens` from source, so `primitives`, `components` and `docs-site` can
merge it and drop their structural copies
`[ ]` Merge `main` into `agent/tokens-theme` once plan 019 (motion tokens) lands
there, then promote that commit — `agent/tokens-platform` is a second branch for
this workstream, created because two live sessions shared one worktree (see
`.agents/slop/blockers/2026-10-17-concurrent-tokens-writers.md`), and should be
retired once both branches are one

### Primitives workstream (owner: primitives)

`[x]` Write and index the primitives, icons and Tier 1 plans
`[x]` `packages/icons`: registry, sizing, accessibility rule, invariant tests
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: the `core/` layer (theme re-export, style
      resolution, variants, keyboard, state, layout, selection, loading) with
      tests
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: `ThemeProvider` + density override
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: layout primitives (Box, Stack, Grid, Separator, Spacer, ScrollArea)
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: Text + typography scale
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: Button + ButtonGroup
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: Label, Input, TextArea
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: Checkbox, RadioGroup, Switch, Select
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: Progress, Skeleton, Spinner, Tooltip
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: element-tree test harness + component suites
      (`src/components/testing/element.ts`; render is impossible here, so a test
      asserts on the tree the runtime would receive)
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: package README (theme port, density, component
      list, and the runtime-verification status)
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: docs page + composed example for every Tier 1
      component, co-located in the package (`docs/`, `examples/`); one runtime
      suite mounts every example (plan 047)
`[x]` `packages/icons`: docs page and the icon-gallery example (plan 047)
`[x]` `packages/icons`: the size scale is `@gpuixui/tokens`' `iconSize`, not a
      second copy (plan 024)
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: `Input`/`TextArea` gain an honest `disabled` state
      (read-only, out of the tab order, guarded handlers) — plan 025
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: close three fixable limitations — a named
      `ButtonGroup`, `ScrollArea` scroll deltas, RadioGroup Home/End (plan 048)
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: the RadioGroup focus contract — a per-item focus
      ring, focus following the selection, a derived roving index, and
      `Switch`'s ignored `invalid` prop (plan 049)
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: Tier 1 runtime suites in `runtime/` — 46 tests
      against the real GPUix 0.10.0 `TestRenderer` (layout, controls, fields,
      loading, icons), with the two-direction proof; results in plan 041 §9
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: consume `@gpuixui/tokens` directly — delete the
      structural theme port and the local ring/shadow helpers, use `focusRing`
      and `elevationShadow`, and verify both shipped themes in the runtime
      (plan 021)
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: `alpha` comes from `@gpuixui/tokens`; delete the
      local copy and its test (plan 023)
`[x]` `examples/basic-app`: compose the Tier 1 set into one settings-form workflow
      (typed + `check-types` green; the app itself is **never run** — it needs a
      desktop session, while the primitives it composes are runtime-verified)
`[x]` `packages/primitives`: the extra Tier 1 controls are claimed here (D18):
      `Slider`, `RangeSlider` and `Meter` (plan 053) — value maths, paint,
      element trees, runtime geometry and focus proofs, docs pages and a
      composed example; the rest of the claimed rows are plan 054
`[~]` `packages/primitives`: `NumberField` landed (plan 054): `core/number.ts`,
      element-tree and runtime suites, docs page and an example. `OTPField`,
      `Toggle`, `Rating` remain — one core module, test, docs page and runtime
      proof each
`[ ]` `packages/primitives`: docs pages for every Tier 1 component (docs-site workstream)
`[ ]` **packages/testing** (playground workstream): hoist `runtime/harness.ts`
      into the shared smoke framework once the package lands — plan 041 §2.2
      records why it is duplicated for now

### Cross-workstream dependencies (do not edit their paths — record only)

`[x]` **resolved (D18)**: `COMPONENTS.md`'s extra Tier 1 rows — Slider, Range
      slider, Meter, Number Field, OTP Field, Toggle, Rating — are claimed by
      the primitives workstream: they are single-purpose input/selection/value
      primitives built from `div` + `<input>` + our keyboard contract, which is
      this package's definition (plans 053, 054). They stay outside MISSION's
      Tier 1 list but are in the inventory, so they are built to the same bar.

`[x]` **root**: `nub.lock` is generated by `nub install`; `master` now tracks it,
      so a clean install resolves the same versions (Phase G).
`[ ]` **root**: `.gitignore` ignores `references/`, which does not match the
      `references` **symlink** the supervisor creates in each worktree. It
      therefore shows as untracked, and a `git add -A` at the root would commit a
      symlink to an absolute path outside the repo. Ignore `references` without
      the trailing slash.

`[!]` **swarm runner**: one writer per worktree. Add
      `opencode run --session swarm-<ws>` to the generated runner, count live
      sessions in `agent_alive`, and land `scripts/check-single-writer.sh` as the
      regression guard. Full evidence and the fix:
      `.agents/slop/plans/022-swarm-single-writer.md`.
`[x]` **root**: `PLAN.md`'s "GPUix cannot run" decision (now D10 after merging
      `master`'s infrastructure decisions) is marked superseded: plan 140 built
      the binding and plan 041 used it.
`[x]` **tokens workstream**: `packages/tokens` exports light and dark themes that
      are the primitives' `PrimitiveTheme` (plan 021 proves it in the offline and
      runtime suites)
`[ ]` **playground workstream**: resolve the runtime blocker — either run the
      published wasm renderer in headless Chrome
      (`@gpuix/native@0.10.0/wasm`, COOP/COEP headers, `--enable-unsafe-swiftshader`),
      or get a `darwin-x64` source build / a GUI session
`[ ]` **playground workstream**: Tier 1 runtime tests in `packages/testing` —
      render, hit-test, Tab order, Enter/Space activation, checkbox/switch toggle,
      radio arrow navigation, scroll offset, a11y-tree dump. These are the tests
      that move a `wip` component row to `done`
`[ ]` **docs-site workstream**: Tier 1 component pages + the `docs/preview-strategy.md`
      decision (code examples plus a companion native playground, never a silent
      HTML/CSS reimplementation)
`[ ]` **licensing**: record the GPUix (Apache-2.0) and Lucide (ISC) provenance and
      any icon/blend decision in `LICENSES/`

## Phase C — Tier 1–2 components

`[~]` `[███░░░░░░░]` 1/3

`[~]` Tier 1 foundational components (code + test + example + docs + inventory):
      all 19 components have code, tests, a runtime-verified interaction, an
      in-package docs page, a mounted example and an inventory row; **docs-site
      pages are still pending** (docs-site workstream)
`[ ]` Tier 2 composition/feedback components (same bar)
`[x]` Verify every component in both themes (`runtime/theme.runtime.test.tsx`: both palettes, a live switch, and no colour outside the active palette)

## Phase D — data and workspace components

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/3

`[ ]` Tier 3 data presentation
`[ ]` Tier 4 desktop workspace (panels, docking, tabs, command palette)
`[ ]` Verify critical interactions in the real runtime

## Phase E — specialised components

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/2

`[ ]` Tier 5 specialised components where justified
`[ ]` Document every capability GPUix does not provide, with evidence

## Phase F — integration and polish

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/3

`[ ]` Consistency, keyboard, themes, composability pass
`[ ]` Performance and packaging
`[ ]` Docs truth pass against the implementation

## Phase G — release readiness

`[ ]` `[░░░░░░░░░░]` 0/3

`[ ]` Clean-environment install and public-export checks
`[ ]` Licence inventory and attribution complete
`[ ]` All gates green (`nub run check`, `nub run lint`, `nub run test`)

## Swarm-owned blockers (fix these)

- **B1** GPUix native bindings fail to install (blocks the playground + every native smoke test).
- **B2** No durable scheduler — the swarm runs on a detached daemon; launchd and cron do not fire here.

Both are specified in ; each fix starts with a plan under .

- **Docs: platform toggle (macOS / Linux / Windows / Default)** — every component preview switches platform style; the styles are real editable token themes in packages/tokens, not docs-only CSS (see MISSION.md).
